# About me


I am trained as a computational chemist, but at heart, I am more of a mathematician and physicist. Programming feels like wielding a magic wandâ€”it empowers me to achieve remarkable results and explore bold ideas. It enhances and completes my mathematical instincts.

I am passionate about applying machine learning to practical problems, ranging from drug discovery and supply chain optimization to refining trading strategies in the stock market. I created this GitHub profile to showcase some of the machine learning projects Iâ€™ve worked on and to collaborate on future projects.

Iâ€™m excited to connect with others here. Feel free to reach out!
